pytron provides a simple, eventough useless way to access your favorite tron quotes.
I created this because the name pytron came up to my mind and I was in mood to code this little snippet.
Enjoy it, use it in a project or in your MOTD or do whatever you want.

You can add your own quotes by editing the quotes file, note that quotes aren't seperated by newlines but by two semicolons (;;)
If you add any quotes I'd be happy to merge them so everyone can access them.

Enjoy
