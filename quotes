Crom: Look. This... is all a mistake. I'm just a compound interest program. I work at a savings and loan! I can't play these video games!
Guard: Sure you can, pal. Look like a natural athlete if I ever saw one.
Crom: Who, me? Are you kidding? No, I run out to check on T-bill rates, I get outta breath. Hey, look, you guys are gonna make my user, Mr. Henderson, very angry. He's a full-branch manager.
Guard: Great. Another religious nut.

Master Control Program: You've enjoyed all the power you've been given, haven't you? I wonder how you'd take to working in a pocket calculator.
;;
Dumont: Yes I'm old. Old enough to remember when the MCP was just a chess program!
;;
Kevin Flynn: On the other side of the screen, it all looks so easy.
;;
Master Control Program: You're in trouble, program. Why don't you make it easy on yourself. Who's your user?
CLU: Forget it, mister high-and-mighty Master Control! You aren't making me talk!
Master Control Program: Suit yourself.

Sark: [Paces back and forth on the deck of his carrier as he addresses his new recruits] Greetings. The Master Control Program has chosen you to serve your system on the Game Grid. Those of you who continue to profess a belief in the Users will receive the standard substandard training which will result in your eventual elimination. Those of you who renounce this superstitious and hysterical belief will be eligible to join the warrior elite of the MCP. You will each receive an identity disc.
[Displays his own disc to the crowd]
Sark: Everything you do or learn will be imprinted on this disc. If you lose your disc, or fail to follow commands, you will be subject to immediate deresolution. That will be all.
;;
Tron: My User has information that could... that could make this a free system again! No, really! You'd have programs lined up just to use this place, and no MCP looking over your shoulder.
;;
Kevin Flynn: [Zooms past a plethora of tanks on his lightcycle] I shouldn't have written all of those tank programs.
;;
Master Control Program: [keyboard clacks as Flynn gains access to the system] You shouldn't have come back, Flynn.
Kevin Flynn: Hey, hey, hey, it's the big Master Control Program everybody's talking about.
Master Control Program: [calmly] Sit right there; make yourself comfortable. Remember the time we used to spend playing chess together?
Master Control Program: [Flynn continues typing] That isn't going to do you any good, Flynn.
[Flynn launches a compute-intensive program]
Master Control Program: I'm afraid... stop, please. You realize I cannot allow this!
Kevin Flynn: How are you going to run the universe if you can't answer a few unsolvable problems? Come on, big fella, let's see what you got.
Master Control Program: I'd like to go against you and see what your made of.
Kevin Flynn: You know, you look nothing like your pictures.
Master Control Program: I'm warning you. You're entering a big error, Flynn.
[manipulates dematerialization gun and targets Flynn]
Master Control Program: I'm going to have to put you on the game grid.
Kevin Flynn: Games? You want games? I'll give you games. I'll...
[klaxon blares; dematerialization gun fires at Flynn]

Master Control Program: Hello, Mr. Dillinger. Thank you for coming back early.
Ed Dillinger: No problem, Master C. If you've seen one Consumer Electronics Show, you've seen them all.
;;
Master Control Program: There's a 68.71 percent chance you're right.
Ed Dillinger: Cute.
Master Control Program: End of Line.
;;
Ram: Do you believe in the Users?
Crom: Sure I do. If I don't have a User, then who wrote me?
;;
Master Control Program: You're getting brutal, Sark. Brutal and needlessly sadistic.
Sark: Thank you, Master Control.
;;
[Crom is upset about being sent to the Game Grid by the MCP.]
Crom: I mean, sending me down here to play games! Who does he calculate that he is?
;;
Master Control Program: Mr. Dillinger, I am so very disappointed in you!
Ed Dillinger: I'm sorry.
Master Control Program: I can't afford to have an independent programmer monitoring me. Do you realize how many outside systems I've gone into? How many many programs I've appropriated?
;;
Ed Dillinger: It's my fault. I programmed you to want too much.
Master Control Program: I was planning to hit the Pentagon next week.
Ed Dillinger: [alarmed] The Pentagon?
Master Control Program: It shouldn't be any harder than any other big company. But now... this is what I get for using humans.
Ed Dillinger: Now, wait a minute, I wrote you!
Master Control Program: I've gotten 2,415 times smarter since then.
Ed Dillinger: What do you want with the Pentagon?
Master Control Program: The same thing I'd want with the Kremlin. I'm bored with corporations. With the information I can access, I can run things 900 to 1200 times better than any human.
Ed Dillinger: If you think you're superior to us...
Master Control Program: You wouldn't want me to dig up Flynn's file and read it up on a VDT at The Times, would you?
[An image washes over the screen in Dillinger's desk. It shows a newspaper with Dillinger's face on the front page, along with the headline "ENCOM C.E.O. INDICTED".]
Ed Dillinger: You wouldn't dare!

[Lora and Dr. Gibbs are preparing to digitize an orange.]
Dr. Lora Baines: Well, here goes nothing.
Dr. Walter Gibbs: Interesting! Interesting! You hear what you just said? "Here goes nothing."
Dr. Lora Baines: Well, I meantâ€”
Dr. Walter Gibbs: See, what we plan to do is to turn something into nothing, and back again. So you might just as well have said "Here goes something, here comes nothing!" Hah?
Dr. Lora Baines: Right...
;;
Alan Bradley: [about the digitizing laser] Great. Can it send me to Hawaii?
Dr. Lora Baines: Yep, but you gotta purchase your program 30 days in advance.
