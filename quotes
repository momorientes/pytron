Crom: Look. This... is all a mistake. I'm just a compound interest program. I work at a savings and loan! I can't play these video games!
Guard: Sure you can, pal. Look like a natural athlete if I ever saw one.
Crom: Who, me? Are you kidding? No, I run out to check on T-bill rates, I get outta breath. Hey, look, you guys are gonna make my user, Mr. Henderson, very angry. He's a full-branch manager.
Guard: Great. Another religious nut.

Master Control Program: You've enjoyed all the power you've been given, haven't you? I wonder how you'd take to working in a pocket calculator.

Dumont: Yes I'm old. Old enough to remember when the MCP was just a chess program!
;;
Kevin Flynn: On the other side of the screen, it all looks so easy.
;;
Master Control Program: You're in trouble, program. Why don't you make it easy on yourself. Who's your user?
CLU: Forget it, mister high-and-mighty Master Control! You aren't making me talk!
Master Control Program: Suit yourself.

Sark: [Paces back and forth on the deck of his carrier as he addresses his new recruits] Greetings. The Master Control Program has chosen you to serve your system on the Game Grid. Those of you who continue to profess a belief in the Users will receive the standard substandard training which will result in your eventual elimination. Those of you who renounce this superstitious and hysterical belief will be eligible to join the warrior elite of the MCP. You will each receive an identity disc.
[Displays his own disc to the crowd]
Sark: Everything you do or learn will be imprinted on this disc. If you lose your disc, or fail to follow commands, you will be subject to immediate deresolution. That will be all.

Tron: My User has information that could... that could make this a free system again! No, really! You'd have programs lined up just to use this place, and no MCP looking over your shoulder.

Kevin Flynn: [Zooms past a plethora of tanks on his lightcycle] I shouldn't have written all of those tank programs.
;;
Master Control Program: [keyboard clacks as Flynn gains access to the system] You shouldn't have come back, Flynn.
Kevin Flynn: Hey, hey, hey, it's the big Master Control Program everybody's talking about.
Master Control Program: [calmly] Sit right there; make yourself comfortable. Remember the time we used to spend playing chess together?
Master Control Program: [Flynn continues typing] That isn't going to do you any good, Flynn.
[Flynn launches a compute-intensive program]
Master Control Program: I'm afraid... stop, please. You realize I cannot allow this!
Kevin Flynn: How are you going to run the universe if you can't answer a few unsolvable problems? Come on, big fella, let's see what you got.
Master Control Program: I'd like to go against you and see what your made of.
Kevin Flynn: You know, you look nothing like your pictures.
Master Control Program: I'm warning you. You're entering a big error, Flynn.
[manipulates dematerialization gun and targets Flynn]
Master Control Program: I'm going to have to put you on the game grid.
Kevin Flynn: Games? You want games? I'll give you games. I'll...
[klaxon blares; dematerialization gun fires at Flynn]
